## Linear algebra

### SVD
* **SVD Introduction.ipynb:** This notebook accompanies my introductory [blog post](https://talwarabhimanyu.github.io/blog/2018/07/21/svd) on Singular Value Decomposition. It demonstrates the concept of Singular Vectors with the help of factorization of a greyscale image.
* **SVD - Ridge Regression.ipynb:** This notebook accompanies my second blog post on SVD. It utilizes SVD to gain insights into Ridge Regression. This is motivated by Section 3.4.1 of the book _The Elements of Statistical Learning_ by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman.

## Deep Learning from Scratch
This repository will contain my Python implementations of various Deep Learning architectures, without use of third party Deep Learning libraries like PyTorch and Tensorflow.

### RNN from Scratch
* This project accompanies my [blog post](https://talwarabhimanyu.github.io/blog/2018/07/31/rnn-backprop) on RNNs where I explain in detail, the mathematics required for backpropogation through an RNN.
* The notebook 'RNN from Scratch.ipynb' implements uses the equations I derive to build an RNN without using Pytorch or Tensorflow.

### LSTM from Scratch
* This project picks up from my previous project 'RNN from Scratch' and implements an LSTM in Python using the equations I derive in an accompanying blog post (to come soon!)
